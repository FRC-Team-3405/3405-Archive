This is the official folder for our robots participating in or contributing towards gameplay in **Rapid React**.

### Robots ###
- **Andre the Giant**: Our main competition bot and supreme pusher of mechanum and swerve bots. Offense bots beware.
- **Bob**: One of two recycled drivebases and part of our line of test bots!
- **Bot Ross**: Our 2020 robot, re-imagined in Java to better serve as our primary test bot!
- **DuckBot**: The second of two recycled drivebases to round out our test line of bots.
- **Mak**: Our test mechanum bot and primary target of defense practice. Holds the power of a brand-new RoboRio 2.0!
